These are utilities that go with the Bio::DB::GFF module:

load_gff.pl	      Slow but foolproof GFF table to database loader.
bulk_load_gff.pl      Fast loader, but wipes database clean each time.
fast_load_gff.pl      EXPERIMENTAL incremental loader that is as fast
		       as bulk loader, but only works on Unix platforms.
generate_histogram.pl Generate histogram of sequence features, for use with
		       generic genome browser.
process_gadfly.pl     Tweak GadFly GFF files for loading (drosophila).
process_wormbase.pl   Tweak WormBase GFF files for loading (elegans)
process_sgd.pl        Turn SGD feature dumps into GFF files for loading (saccharomyces).
process_ncbi_human.pl Turn NCBI feature dumps into GFF files for loading (human).
